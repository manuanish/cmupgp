### Question 1
What have you learned this year, and how can you apply [it] to real-world situations?
<br/>
#### Response
I have learned a lot of things this year, and in my humble opinion, it would be
a waste of words to try and express every single "Aha!" moment here. Below I
have done my best to describe one of the few really beautiful fields of study
I came across and how I applied it to my project.

We often take it for granted that the messages we send on our devices will be
private, but how can we be so sure? Moreover, can we blindly trust the large
corporations so infamously known for hoarding user data?

I dived into the sea of modern-day cryptography with these concerns in mind.
I began by learning how encryption methods had changed throughout history,
starting from the basic Caeser Cipher to today's modern techniques in encryption.

I broadly touched on each core concept in cryptography and used my newfound
knowledge to create an application that could be used to secure user data,
send private messages, and so much more.
<br/>
### Question 2
What was the most interesting thing you learned this year?


#### Response
The pursuit of knowledge is one feeling that I cannot compare to any other;
even more so begin to describe. Learning about the RSA Algorithm was one of the fascinating subjects I took a look at.

Most people are unaware, but RSA is an acronym Rivest–Shamir–Adleman, a public-key
cryptosystem is one of the oldest and yet most widely used for data transmission.
It was developed secretly in 1973 at a British Intelligence Agency by an English
mathematician. Later on, it was declassified for public use.

Getting my hands wet and learning about the simple ingenuity behind the complex algorithm was
in my opinion quite interesting; even more so, implementing it in an application.

<br/>
### Question 3
If you could change anything about this course, what would it be? How would [you] envision it being implemented?

#### Response
Overall, I think that the course was really well structured for a beginner to
grasp the fundamentals of python. In my opinion, I would not change too much of
the course material.

However, I would improve the auto-grading system.
At many times, the bot would not be able to detect if my answer was correct
due to something as simple as a typo or if my shape was 1 pixel off.
