## <RepoLockedIcon size={25} /> What is CMU PGP?
CMU PGP is an [encryption program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software) that provides:

- â€¢ cryptographic privacy
- â€¢ authentication

for data communication. CMU PGP is used for [signing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature),
[encrypting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption), and [decrypting](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Decryption&redirect=no)
texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and
to increase the security of e-mail communications.
<br/>
> PGP is an acronym for "Pretty Good Privacy"

<br/>

## <DownloadIcon size={25} /> Installation
Let's take a look at how we can get started using CMU PGP.
<br/>
### 1. Clone the repository
First, we clone the repository using the command

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/manuanish/CMU-PGP.git && cd CMU-PGP
```
<br/>
This will create a local copy of the code in the directory where the command is run.
<br/>
### 2. Activate the `venv`
Now we can activate the [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
<br/>
This will allow python to access the packages required to run the application.

<br/>
### 3. Run the application
We can start the program

```bash
(.venv) $ python3 src/main.py
```
<br/>
And thats it! ðŸŽ‰ The program should be running in your terminal.

- `cgp --full-gen-key`  Generate a secure public/private key pair for [asymmetric encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)

- `cgp --clear-sign`  [Digitally sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) a document, file, email, etc. to ensure that the message is actually from the sender (and not an imposter).

- `cgp --encrypt`  [Encrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) a document, file, email, etc. such that it can **only be decrypted by the designated reciever**.

- `cgp --decrypt`  [Decrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Decryption&redirect=no) a document, file, email, etc. **only if the you are the designated reciever**.
