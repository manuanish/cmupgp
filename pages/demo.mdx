### <ListUnorderedIcon size={24} /> List of concepts I used
I feel that the CMU CS Course has much to do with graphical modeling using python3
instead of programming principles so, I have included, to the best of my efforts, some concepts that
were used in this project.
- Functions that use return values
- String Methods
- List Methods
- Math functions
- Random values
