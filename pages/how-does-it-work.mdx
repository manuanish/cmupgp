# <ArrowSwitchIcon size={32} /> Asymmetric key cryptography
**Public-key cryptography**, or **asymmetric cryptography**, is a cryptographic system
that uses pairs of keys. Each pair consists of a public key
(which may be known to others) and a private key
(which may not be known by anyone except the owner).


The generation of such key pairs depends on [cryptographic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) which are based
on mathematical problems termed [one-way functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function). Effective security requires
keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security.
<br/>
<br/>
## Short example
To put the words above into context, let's look at an example to understand asymmetric encyrption better.

### The problem
Suppose Alice wishes to send Bob a valuable diamond, but the jewel will be stolen
if sent unsecured. Both Alice and Bob have a variety of padlocks, but they don't
own the same ones, meaning that their keys cannot open the other's locks.
<br/>
> How did Alice send the jewel to Bob?

<br/>
<br/>
### <LightBulbIcon size={24} /> Solution
Let's take a look at how one might solve this problem.
1. Bob first sends Alice an unlocked padlock. Note that Bob would give *anyone* an
unlocked padlock, as the only use for one is to send Bob something.
2. Alice adds Bob's lock and sends the package to Bob, and
3. Bob removes his lock and opens the package.

## <FileZipIcon size={25} /> The Algorithm
The implementation of RSA makes heavy use of [modular arithmetic](https://brilliant.org/wiki/modular-arithmetic/), [Euler's theorem](https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-theorem/),
and [Euler's totient function](https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-totient-function/). Notice that each step of the algorithm only involves
multiplication, so it is easy for a computer to perform.
<br/>
### Creating a public key
First, the receiver chooses two large prime numbers $p$ and $q$. Their product, $n$, will be half of the public key.

$$
\{p, q\} \in \mathbb{P} \qquad \land \qquad n = pq
$$

The receiver then calculates

$$
\varphi(pq)=(p-1)(q-1)
$$

<br/>
<blockquote>
#### Eulers Totient Function (refresher)
Given a number $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, we know that:

$$
n = \prod_{i=0}^{k} p_i^{\alpha_i} \qquad \text{where} \qquad \forall \ i \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \implies p_i \in \mathbb{P}
$$

Thus, we define

$$
\varphi(n) = n\prod_{p|n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)
$$

##### Corollary
This directly implies that

$$
\sum_{d|n} \varphi(d) = n
$$
</blockquote>
<br/>


and chooses a number $e$ such that:
$$
\gcd{(\varphi(pq), e)} = 1
$$

#### Note:
In practice, $e$ is often chosen to be $2^{16}+1=65537$, though it can be as small as $3$ in some cases. $e$ will be the other half of the public key.
<br/>
### Creating a private key
The receiver calculates the modular inverse $d$ of $e$ modulo $\varphi(n)$. In other words,
$$
de \equiv 1 \pmod{{\small\varphi(n)}}.
$$

$d$ is the private key.
<br/>
<br/>
### <PaperAirplaneIcon size={25} /> Sending messages
To transmit a message, follow these steps:
#### 1. Converting your message to a "number"
First, the sender converts his message into a number $m$. One common conversion process uses the ASCII alphabet:
<div style={{overflow: 'hidden'}}>
| A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  | H  | I  | J  | K  | L  | M  | N  | O  | P  | Q  | R  | S  | T  | U  | V  | W  | X  | Y  | Z  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 65 | 66 | 67 | 68 | 69 | 70 | 71 | 72 | 73 | 74 | 75 | 76 | 77 | 78 | 79 | 80 | 81 | 82 | 83 | 84 | 85 | 86 | 87 | 88 | 89 | 90 |
</div>
<br/>
For example, the message "HELLO" would be encoded as $7269767679$.
> It is important that $m < n$, as otherwise the message will be lost when taken modulo $n$, so if $n$ is smaller than the message, it will be sent in pieces.

<br/>
#### 2. Encrypting the message
The sender then calculates:

$$
c \equiv m^e \pmod{n}
$$

$c$ is the **ciphertext**, or the encrypted message. Besides the public key, this is the only information an attacker will be able to steal.
<br/>
#### 3. Decrypting the message
The receiver computes:

$$
c^d \equiv m \pmod n
$$

thus retrieving the original number $m$.
<br/>
<blockquote>
#### Justification
While I was re-reading this document, I realized that the above isn't immediately obvious, so I have provided below a quick justification on why it is true.

##### Proof
Euler's theorem tells us that
$$
m^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod n
$$
We deliberately chose $d$ so that
$$
de \equiv 1 \pmod{{\small\varphi(n)}}
$$
Note that such a $d$ exists by the definition of $e$. This means that there exists an integer $k$ satisfying $de=k\varphi(n)+1$. Then:

$$
\begin{align*}
m^{de}&\equiv  m^{k\varphi(n)+1} \\
&\equiv m^{k\varphi(n)}\cdot m \\
&\equiv \big(m^{\varphi(n)}\big)^k\cdot m \\
&\equiv 1^k\cdot m \\
\therefore \ \ m^{de} &\equiv m \pmod{n}
\end{align*}
$$
$\blacksquare$
</blockquote>
<br />
#### 4. Reading the message
The receiver finally translates $m$ back into letters, retrieving the original message.

## <UnlockIcon size={30} /> Vulnerabilities
In 1994, MIT mathematician Peter Shor developed a theoretical algorithm (a.k.a Shor's Algorithm) for
[quantum computers](https://brilliant.org/wiki/quantum-computing/) that factors
numbers exponentially faster than current algorithms do. However, since only
small quantum computers have been built, as of 2022 the algorithm has managed
to factor 178-bit numbers. The largest to date is:

$$
383123885216472214589586724601136274484797633168671371
$$
<br/>
<br/>
### <NorthStarIcon size={25} /> A touch of quantum physics
For those who are familliar with a quantum physics, I have left what is in my opinion a very beautiful equation (from Shor's 1994
paper) describing the simultaneity of qubits on a quantum fourier transform.

$$
\displaystyle y_{k}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {N}}}\sum _{n=0}^{N-1}x_{n}\omega _{N}^{-kn},\quad k=0,1,2,\ldots ,N-1
$$
